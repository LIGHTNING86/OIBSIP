<h2>Level 2 - Task 1: Calculator</h2>
Simple Calculator Web Application created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have made use of JavaScript functions and methods to calculate the answers in a simple method rather than writing seperate code to evaluate the solution using loops and user-defined functions.
<br><br>
The special Easter Egg that I have added in when the solution equals to the digits '90' is made possible using special alert box that I used. If you want to check it out, visit the following link: <a href="https://sweetalert2.github.io/">Sweet Alert</a>
